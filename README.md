This documentation guideline serves as a boilerplate template and tutorial for writing good, structured documentation of your codebase.

## Introduction

Good documentation is like a good book: Fun to read and easy to understand but hard (and often annoying) to write. Even though it is the least exciting part in software development it is still the developer's responsibility to ensure a comprehensible and well-documented codebase.

Because I get worked up over badly documented dependencies, libraries, etc. on which my work depends on I decided to come up with a guideline and template that I can use for my own projects as well.

So this project shall help developers to write an easy to understand documentation and provides a template which can be reused and adapted throughout different projects. All the given advice in this document provides a framework which can be altered. It shall give developers a kick start and **DOES NOT** enforce any strict rules.

No more excuses for writing (good) documentation, fellows! üìùüòà

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This boilerplate is written in Markdown language so what you will need is a text editor and some knowledge on how to write Markdown.

- [Markdown Basics][markdown-basics]
- [adam-p's Markdown Cheatsheet][adam-p-markdown-cheatsheet]
- [Online Markdown editor][online-markdown-editor]

Furthermore, if you need some additional information on how to write documentation I encourage you to read the following resources:

- [A beginner‚Äôs guide to writing documentation][beginners-guide-to-documentation]
- [Style Guides for Documentation][documentation-style-guide]

### Installation

This README already serves as a boilerplate and as an example of well-written documentation. However, a template with less text and clear instructions is provided under [template/README.md][readme-template].

So here is the suggested approach for this project:

1. Read through this whole README first to get a grasp of what makes good documentation (in my opinion).
2. Take note of the advice given in this README.
3. Take a look at the README in [template/README.md][readme-template]. (Notice how it has the same structure as this README? The difference is it has less text and clear instructions.)
4. Clone this repository.
5. Copy the README from [template/README.md][readme-template] and paste it into your project.
6. Write documentation that rocks! üé∏

## Documentation

TODO: Describe the structure of good documentation (table of contents, links, and references, etc.)

TODO: Describe how the documentation shall be written (grammar, tenses, formulate for DAU)

TODO: Explain when and how to use a documentation tool

TODO: Give bad, good and best examples if code snippets are included

TODO: How files and code references should be highlighted

TODO: Include examples of well-documented projects

## Contribution

If you think this project lacks some further crucial information or you have some good advice, best-practices or crazy ideas feel free to submit a pull request or file an issue under [github.com/alex-lechner/documentation-guideline/issues][issue-tracker]
