## Introduction

Further elaborate on what your project is about and the motivation behind it. Don't write a book but keep it short and simple (max. 5 - 6 sentences).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [List AND link all necessary dependencies, libraries, modules, helpful links and tutorials in regards to your project.](#)
- [Even though you use a dependency management tool like NPM or Pipfile.](#)
- [This helps contributors to understand your project's scaffold.](#)
- [And your contributors and team members are faster set up with your project.](#)
- If specific hardware or operating system is required, make sure to mention it too.

### Installation

1. Write step-by-step instructions on how to set up and install the project.
2. Don't assume that your team members know what to do! So include every little step.
3. Provide instructions for Linux, OSX, and Windows if possible.

```
Don't forget to include code snippets for easier understanding!
```

## Documentation

Either write your documentation here or [provide a link to your extensive documentation website][documentation-link].

If you have a big code base and lots of things to document you should consider using a documentation tool like [Sphinx][sphinx], [Mkdocs][mkdocs], [Gitbook][gitbook] or any other documentation tool to generate static HTML-files which you then can host on a server.
